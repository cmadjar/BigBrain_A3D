# BigBrain A3D

## BigBrain

The BigBrain is the brain of a 65 years old man with no neurological or psychiatric
diseases in clinical records at time of death. The brain was embedded in parafin and
sectioned in 7404 coronal histological sections (20 microns), stained for cell bodies.
The BigBrain is the digitized reconstruction of the hi-res histological sections 
(20 microns isotropic).

## Dataset content

This dataset contains the Atelier3D client files for viewing the BigBrain model from the BigBrain release 2015 
published in the [BigBrain Project website](https://bigbrainproject.org).

Atelier3d is a licensed proprietary software developed at the NRC in Ottawa. Note that the Atelier3d viewer itself is not provided on this dataset.

## Reference and more information

The BigBrain dataset is the result of a collaborative effort between the
teams of Dr. Katrin Amunts and Dr. Karl Zilles (Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich)
and Dr. Alan Evans (Montreal Neurological Institute).
